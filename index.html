                                I'm Briar Smith,<br><br>
                                I love to teach and I love to learn.
                                My main focus is in STEM, incorporating physical systems as mathematical models to
                                create a system or algorithm to deploy engineered technology. However, this is not a
                                    definition of what I do, it is only a subset. For example, I've had experience
                                    related to web development, I take courses in application programming, digital logic and
                                    firmware engineering, I have a strong interest in quantum mechanics, and I love working
                                    with autonomous technology.<br><br>
                                    My involvement in student teams takes up majority of my time. The student design team
                                    experience is priceless to me because it allows me to learn about a wide variety of
                                    subjects, all while having fun.

                                My roles at BrainStation are what marked the beginning of my lifelong career of teaching and
                                    learning. Ever since I was a young child, I have been fascinated with the learning and
                                    teaching process; the key factor to success, innovation, and lifelong cognitive
                                    strength.

                                    For some people, coding can seem like an intimidating new task. This is the challenge that
                                    BrainStation overcomes, with needless to say, outstanding results; as seen in Forbes'
                                    30 under 30: Education.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The founders of BrainStation are a group of lifelong learners who introduced the largest
                                    free youth coding course in Canada. Through their core values and connections with
                                    corporate partnerships, BrainStation has been able to provide full scholarships to youth
                                    who are also lifelong, passionate learners. In the summer of 2015, I taught, managed,
                                    and assisted lectures in a cutting-edge course in digital literacy, to introduce youth
                                    to coding. In just 4 weeks, students were able to build, test and market a web
                                    application for a social awareness that is important to them. BrainStation's philosophy
                                    isn't limited to students -- they reinforce that nobody is too old or too busy to learn
                                    -- by offering part time courses for working professionals, freelancers and
                                    entrepreneurs.
                                    <br><br>

                                Overall, I was extremely satisfied with my experience at BrainStation. The companies core
                                    values are aligned with my own, which makes my work at BrainStation a part of my journey
                                    to lifelong wisdom, innovation, and teaching. A special thank you to Danielle Thé, my
                                    direct manager, and Jason Field, formally the CEO, the brains behind BrainStation.

                                    Waterloop is the University of Waterloo’s Hyperloop team for the SpaceX Competition in
                                    California. There are 2 phases to the competition.  The first phase is the design
                                    proposal, which only 30 teams of over 1400 are selected to move forward into production
                                    of the pod. The second phase is the creation of a half-scale Hyperloop pod. Once I caught
                                    wind of the competition, I knew I had to join in and be a part of the experience. I was
                                    able to see my contributions to the electrical levitation circuit and the Inertial
                                    Measurement Unit which were embedded directly into the pod.

                                    It’s easy to get caught up in the hype of such an amazing competition. What makes the
                                    experience so special are the students you are working with throughout the process.
                                    Together, you are representing the university and student design teams on an international
                                    level, and putting your valuable skills to use. The amount of information I learned
                                    through Waterloop was incredible – and it was <i>free!</i> I will post an update with the

                                    amount of work there is to accomplish, the “think-on-your-feet” mentality; this
                                    environment provided me with the feeling of satisfaction and great accomplishment.
                                    From my first day at Mozzaz, I knew I was going to be in for a true learning experience.

                                    Throughout my entire journey, I picked up many valuable skills at Mozzaz: technical,
                                    analytical and qualitative. Enhancing coding and problem solving skills in an AGILE
                                    environment, understanding the product development lifecycle, and obtaining experience
                                    with version control systems such as Git, to name a few. These are all very important
                                    skills to me since I am always interested in developing my software skills and any tools
                                    to make it easier. In particular, my main role consisted of using JavaScript to
                                    communicate with our backend, written in C#, to display updated customer information
                                    on our mobile applications, communicated from portal settings set by the users.

                                    Mozzaz Corporation was a fantastic place to be. The Mozzaz philosophy of making lives
                                    easier by diagnosing mental health issues motivates me to create my own application
                                    that will make people’s lives easier. I am very thankful for such a valuable opportunity
                                    to work at a company like Mozzaz, and wish everyone there great success in the future.
